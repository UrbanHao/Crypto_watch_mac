> Initial drop packaged on 2025-10-24 10:43:07 (UTC).  
> Includes your uploaded file **`crypto_watch_mac_popup.py`**, plus a ready-to-use `.gitignore` and this README.

## Structure
```
crypto_watch_mac/
├─ crypto_watch_mac_popup.py
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (Public), named `crypto_watch_mac` (or any name you like).
2. Upload these three files via the GitHub web UI (or use a Git client).
3. (Optional) Add other modules later — e.g., `indicators.py`, `exits.py`, `ui.py` — keeping this as the initial baseline.

## Notes
- `.gitignore` excludes Python caches, virtual environments, logs, macOS artifacts, and local secrets.
- Keep API keys out of the repo. Use environment variables or a local `.env` that remains uncommitted.
